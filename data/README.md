# Data Directory

This directory holds raw and processed datasets generated by the ingestion and processing
pipelines. The repository ships without large binaries; run `make download-demo` to populate
`data/demo_docs` with sample files.

* `data/raw/`: Raw JSONL output from ingestion jobs
* `data/processed/`: Cleaned chunks ready for embedding
* `data/metadata/`: Metadata for ingested documents
