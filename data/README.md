# Data Directory

This directory holds raw and processed datasets generated by the ingestion and processing
pipelines. The repository ships without large binaries; run `make download-demo` to populate
`data/demo_docs` with sample files. The bootstrap task now writes tiny embedded demo assets
directly from `scripts/download_demo_documents.py` so it succeeds even on air-gapped machines.
Pass `--prefer-remote` if you would like to fetch the latest public revisions instead of the
included samples.

* `data/raw/`: Raw JSONL output from ingestion jobs
* `data/processed/`: Cleaned chunks ready for embedding
* `data/metadata/`: Metadata for ingested documents
