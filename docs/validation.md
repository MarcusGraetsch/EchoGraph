# Human Validation Guide

1. Log into the EchoGraph frontend.
2. Select a cloud guideline from the sidebar or upload a new document through the **Upload document** panel.
3. Hover or click the highlighted passages inside the guideline reader to preview linked regulation excerpts and similarity confidence.
4. Review the candidate matches in the detail drawer, including rationale summaries and the full context snippets.
5. Approve, reject, or adjust the confidence of each match and leave reviewer notes describing your decision.

All validation actions update the `matches` table, preserving an audit trail of reviewer
responsibility.
