# Deployment Guide

## Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

* `api`: FastAPI backend on port 8000
* `frontend`: React SPA (bound to 4173 internally and proxied via Caddy)
* `postgres`: Application database
* `qdrant`: Vector database
* `ingestion-worker`: Runs ingestion CLI jobs
* `processing-worker`: Runs embedding and matching jobs
* `n8n`: Optional workflow orchestrator

## Kubernetes

The manifests under `infra/kubernetes` provide a starting point for deploying to a managed
cluster. Customize secrets and storage classes before applying:

```bash
kubectl apply -k infra/kubernetes/overlays/dev
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/workflows` lint, test, build, and publish container
images to a registry. Configure repository secrets `REGISTRY_USERNAME`, `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, and
`REGISTRY_URL`.

## Bare-metal Ubuntu 22.04 (Contabo VM) Setup

The project can run on a fresh Contabo virtual machine that ships only with
Ubuntu 22.04. The following checklist prepares the host, deploys the stack, and
opens access from your local laptop.

### 1. Prepare the VM

1. SSH into the instance: `ssh ubuntu@<vm-ip>`
2. Update the base system and install build tools:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y git build-essential curl ca-certificates gnupg lsb-release
   ```

### 2. Install Runtime Prerequisites

EchoGraph expects Docker, Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+, and pnpm for the frontend.

1. **Docker Engine and Compose plugin**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
   newgrp docker
   ```

   Verify with `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.

2. **Python tooling**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

3. **Node.js 18 and pnpm**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g pnpm
   ```

### 3. Clone the Repository and Bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/EchoGraph.git
cd EchoGraph
make bootstrap
```

The bootstrap target configures Python environments, installs backend/frontend
dependencies, and downloads demo documents.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a `.env` file with overrides such as `DATABASE_URL`, `QDRANT_URL`, or
`N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET` if you are not using the default docker-compose settings.

### 5. Launch the Stack

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Check container status with `docker compose ps` and stream logs via
`docker compose logs -f <service>`.

By default the `frontend` service is only reachable through the bundled
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) reverse proxy. Caddy serves HTTPS on port 443
using its internal certificate authority so every deployment has encryption
from the start.

### 6. Open Firewall Ports

If UFW is enabled, allow inbound traffic for the HTTPS endpoint and, optionally,
HTTP if you want automatic redirects:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

Expose any additional ports you require (e.g., 5678 for n8n webhooks).

### 7. Trust the autogenerated certificate

Because browsers cannot validate certificates that come from a private
certificate authority, you must install Caddy's root CA locally the first time
you deploy to a fresh VM. Run the helper script on the VM (inside the
repository directory) to copy the certificate out of the container:

```bash
python3 scripts/export_caddy_root_ca.py --output caddy-root.crt
```

The command copies the root certificate from the running Caddy container into
`caddy-root.crt` on the VM. Download the file to your workstation with `scp`
and import it into your operating system's trust store:

* **Windows**: Run `certmgr.msc`, import the file into “Trusted Root Certification
  Authorities”.
* **macOS**: Open “Keychain Access”, import the file, and mark it as “Always
  Trust”.
* **Linux**: Copy the file into `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and run
  `sudo update-ca-certificates`.

After the certificate is trusted, reload the site and the browser will no longer
flag the connection as insecure even when you access the VM by IP address.

### 8. Access from Your Laptop

Open `https://<vm-ip>` (or `https://<your-domain>` once configured) to use the
reviewer UI. The API is available at `https://<vm-ip>/api`. Caddy automatically
redirects HTTP traffic on port 80 to HTTPS.

### 9. Use a public certificate (Optional)

If you control a domain and prefer a publicly trusted certificate, configure
Caddy to request Let's Encrypt certificates instead of the internal CA.

1. Point a DNS `A` (and optionally `AAAA`) record to your VM's IP address.
2. Create or update a `.env` file in the repository root. Include `:443` so IP
   access continues to work alongside the domain:

   ```env
   CADDY_DOMAIN=:443, guidelines.example.com, www.guidelines.example.com
   CADDY_TLS_DIRECTIVE=
   CADDY_ACME_EMAIL=ops@example.com
   ```

3. Restart Caddy so it reloads the environment variables:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate caddy
   ```

   When `CADDY_DOMAIN` includes public hostnames and `CADDY_TLS_DIRECTIVE` is
   empty, Caddy automatically obtains publicly trusted certificates for the
   listed hostnames.

4. Visit `https://guidelines.example.com` to confirm the browser no longer
   prompts for certificate trust.
